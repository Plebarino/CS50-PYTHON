# retrun statement = Functions send Python values/objects back to the caller.
#                    These values/objects are known as the function's return value.

# takes in two numbers on two new lines
x = int(input("Give two numbers and we will multiply them. \n"))
y = int(input())

# creates a funtion to multply two inputs
def multiply(number1,number2):
    return number1 * number2

# creates a new variable and uses the function
z = multiply(x,y)

# prints the answer of the multiplied numbers
print(z)
